Submitted by: **SENUDA RATNAYAKE**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Mixed up View_Controller and Main.StoryBoard windows.
The numberPad/ decimalPad did not pop up, due to a Xcode bug.
Initailly it was hard to get around with the multiple windows, but after few hours into Xcode, I got more comfortable with the UI.
Was unable to get my finished work uploaded in to gitHub through the Xcode Source Control, which delayed my Pre-work from its submission by 3 days, since I had to learn a way to use Terminal to commit my work o to gitHub.
